Introduction: 

I am showing a few graphs on Gun Violence in the United States, one showing the comparison of all the states by total incidents, a year to year bar chart with the number of victims who were injured or killed, and then I have a line graph comparing the count of the different age groups involved. 

Data/operation abstraction design:

I got this dataset from [Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/duttadebadri/gun-violence-in-usa-insights-forecast) as a csv file. When I first opened it, there were many columns that contained unnecessary colons or dashes, so I had to utilize some split funtions in order to correctly count some of the variables. I also had to convert some of the date values to columns in order to create some of the graphs. The data is from January of 2013 until March of 2018, however upon doing some of the initial counts, i found that both 2013 and 2018 had much less entries than the other years so I decided to remove those years from the charts.

Future work:

I would have loved to include more of a gender comparison in future updates.
